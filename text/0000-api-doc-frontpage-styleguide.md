# Summary

This RFC is a companion to [RFC 1574] concerning API documentation conventions.
This time we focus on the format and style of the "front page" of documentation
as generated by rustdoc. The goal of this RFC is to outline a clear presentation
style for crate documentation that is helpful to new users of a crate. We also
clarify the relationship between the rustdoc front page and the project's
readme. These are the guidelines we'll be using for the rust-lang crates, but
are also meant to help guide community crate authors.

[RFC 1574]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.md

# Motivation

A user's first experience with a crate is often the front page of the crate's
documentation. Taken together with the API documentation and readme, the front
page is a critical piece of understanding a crate's purpose, how to use it, and
its limitations. This RFC furthers our roadmap goal of [providing easy access to
high quality crates][roadmap]. A crate may be otherwise high quality but shoddy
front page documentation can lead people to pass over it.

[roadmap]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap/issues/9

# Detailed design

The front page of the crate should cover three main points. In this RFC, we
cover each in turn.

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [First Example](#first-example)
* [Capabilities](#capabilities)

## Introduction

The first thing potential users of your crates will see is the introductory
summary. This section is a good place to introduce the what and the why of the
crate. A good introduction is concise but also provides enough information for
the reader to understand the purpose of the crate. In addition, a good
introduction provides a learning path for the user as they read the rest of the
documentation.

Here's an example of a good introduction from the [`log`] crate:

[`log`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/log/log/index.html

> A lightweight logging facade.
>
> A logging facade provides a single logging API that abstracts over the actual
> logging implementation. Libraries can use the logging API provided by this
> crate, and the consumer of those libraries can choose the logging framework
> that is most suitable for its use case.
>
> If no logging implementation is selected, the facade falls back to a "noop"
> implementation that ignores all log messages. The overhead in this case is
> very small - just an integer load, comparison and jump.
>
> A log request consists of a target, a level, and a body. A target is a string
> which defaults to the module path of the location of the log request, though
> that default may be overridden. Logger implementations typically use the
> target to filter requests based on some user configuration.

There are several things that make this a good introduction section:

* A concise explanation of the crate's purpose.
* The summary describes how the crate behaves in 3 short paragraphs.
* Even if you don't want to read the rest of the `README`, you have enough to
  get started.
* Readable by a layman, no jargon is introduced in the first few paragraphs.

What do we mean by "no jargon is introduced in the first few paragraphs"? Using
the [`rand`] crate as an exampleâ€”the crate's initial documentation probably
should _not_ include a discussion of cryptographically secure random number
generators since its primary purpose, for most Rust developers, will be to
produce any random number. This information should instead be provided in a
separate section that specifically discusses cryptographically secure random
number generation.

[`rand`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rand/rand/index.html

In general - it's good to give a developer a place to easily learn what your
crate is about. Once they have the general idea, you can dive into more details
that are specific to your crate, including jargon that would be common with its
use.

## First Example

The first example should provide a concise example to help a developer
understand how they can work with your crate. Ideally, this example should only
demonstrate your crate and core Rust functionality. Avoid large examples with
lots of features; larger examples are better fit for the `examples` directory.

Let's look at a sample of a good first example of a crate. Notice that the
author has focused on getting started, showing how to import and use the crate,
and a few simple uses of common functionality.

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate log;

pub fn shave_the_yak(yak: &Yak) {
    info!(target: "yak_events", "Commencing yak shaving for {:?}", yak);

    loop {
        match find_a_razor() {
            Ok(razor) => {
                info!("Razor located: {}", razor);
                yak.shave(razor);
                break;
            }
            Err(err) => {
                warn!("Unable to locate a razor: {}, retrying", err);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Capabilities

The core capabilities of a crate are the main reason people will use your crate.
In the next section, you can document what each of these core capabilities are
and how to use them. For example, in a crate about random numbers, you may have
sections about: generating random numbers, fitting numbers to statistical
distributions, use in cryptography, thread-local random numbers, and so on.

It's helpful to introduce and give a clear description for each capability
separately to help your readers understand each concept individually before they
begin to combine capabilities.

Here's a good example from the `rand` crate:

> ## Thread-local RNG
>
> There is built-in support for a RNG associated with each thread stored in
> thread-local storage. This RNG can be accessed via thread_rng, or used
> implicitly via random. This RNG is normally randomly seeded from an
> operating-system source of randomness, e.g. /dev/urandom on Unix systems, and
> will automatically reseed itself from this source after generating 32 KiB of
> random data.
>
> ## Cryptographic security
>
> An application that requires an entropy source for cryptographic purposes must
> use OsRng, which reads randomness from the source that the operating system
> provides (e.g. /dev/urandom on Unixes or CryptGenRandom() on Windows). The
> other random number generators provided by this module are not suitable for
> such purposes.

Sample code for each crate capability should be as simple as possible and side
effect free. In the `rand` crate, thread safe RNG is demonstrated in 5 lines of
code:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();

if rng.gen() { // random bool
    println!("i32: {}, u32: {}", rng.gen::<i32>(), rng.gen::<u32>());
}
```

After this example, a user should immediately be able to use a thread safe
random number generator in their own program.

More complex source examples should be included as a separate program in the
`examples` directory. Be wary of putting large examples in your doc where users
will have to read past the code to get the beginning of your API documentation.

You should also avoid examples that require understanding of external crates
unless it's absolutely necessary. As a hypothetical example - your logging crate
should not require the user to have experience with [Diesel]. It's okay to leave
these capabilities as an exercise left to the reader.

# How We Teach This

This RFC will be linked from the [Rust API guidelines] in a guideline dedicated
to front page documentation.

[Rust API guidelines]: https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines

As part of the [Libz Blitz], the community and the libs team will evaluate
high-profile crates against this guideline and file issues where improvement is
required. With front page documentation improving across the ecosystem, users
will learn to depend on it and will notice and complain about crates that fall
short. Those crates can improve their front page experience by using this RFC as
guidance.

# Drawbacks

A possible drawback of this approach is that it risks over-specifying a format
that is ill-served for a particular crate. For example, a crate with a lot of
moving parts may need to use more complex examples because smaller examples lose
educational value or overall impact.

# Alternatives

### Example size

We may recommend an upper bound on the size of example code that belongs in the
front page documentation. For example we may say that anything over 40 lines
probably belongs in its own dedicated file in the `examples` directory.

### Frugal with examples

We may recommend only one or two examples of the most basic sort, and links to
`examples` or a website for anything more thorough. During your first
introduction to a crate, links are just as edifying as inline examples. During
your next 1024 times referring to the rustdoc as reference, you are not forced
to scroll past the no longer useful example code.

### Usage section

We may recommend a section or just a lone code block that gives the basic
mechanics of depending on a crate.

```toml
[build-dependencies]
gcc = "0.3"
```

This saves users the effort of:

- Remembering the crate name (crate is gcc, repository is gcc-rs);
- Figuring out what the latest version is;
- Knowing which section to put the dependency into.

### Links to homepage, repo, crates.io

Browsing from a rustdoc front page to any of these other references is currently
obnoxious. On docs.rs they provide these links in a sidebar.

> ![selection_043](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1940490/25786542/03e64c0c-334c-11e7-9a1e-868592d663aa.png)

Some crates provide manual cross-links.

> **[Changelog](#) - [API Documentation](#) - [Cargo](#) - [Repository](#)**

We may recommend that crates do something like this in their frontpage. However,
I believe that this should be a feature request for rustdoc instead.

# Unresolved questions

### Limitations

How best to document a crate's limitations.

### Cargo cfgs

Where documentation for features goes. Serde has this [on the website][serde
website features] and [in Cargo.toml][serde cargo features] but not in rustdoc.

[serde website features]: https://serde.rs/feature-flags.html
[serde cargo features]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/v1.0.0/serde/Cargo.toml#L26-L75

### License boilerplate

This crate is licensed under either of Apache License, Version 2.0,
(LICENSE-APACHE or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or MIT license
(LICENSE-MIT or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at your option. Unless you
explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted bla bla
bla.

Does this need to be in the readme and/or the rustdoc?

### Getting help

The Serde readme has the following stanza. It is designed to catch new users who
may silently struggle and then abandon the crate without getting help.

> Serde developers live in the #serde channel on [`irc.mozilla.org`]. The #rust
> channel is also a good resource with generally faster response time but less
> specific knowledge about Serde. If IRC is not your thing or you don't get a
> good response, we are happy to respond to [GitHub issues][new serde issue] as
> well.

[`irc.mozilla.org`]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
[new serde issue]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/new

Does this belong in the readme and/or the rustdoc?
